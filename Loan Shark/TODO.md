#BUGS & Additions:  I
-selectedForTransactions attribute not persisting
-restrict transactions to > 0.01
-discard changes button for editTransactionView
-Implement no due date (GLOBAL SEARCH dueDate! to make sure everything is correct and implement exceptions if need be)
-sort unpaid people to the top in billsplit of transaction detail view

#LONG TERM GOALS: 
-implement editing people
-fix lag when searching
-Add total owed to home screen
-Add tags

#Priority for next commit: 
-edits in transaction detail regarding due date is not reflected within home page, but editing other fields seems to refresh it
-change the weird hours minutes thing


#Fixed: 
-transaction due date in persondetailview not specific to person
