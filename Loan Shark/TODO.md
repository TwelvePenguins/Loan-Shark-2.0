# BUGS:  I
-Implement no due date
-Scroll away keyboard
-Placeholder value of amount
-weird space in peopleselector
-edits in transaction detail regarding due date is not reflected within home page, but editing other fields seems to refresh it
-wording wrong in transaction detail regarding due/due in as transaction status is not specific to each person
-selectedForTransactions attribute not persisting
-restrict transactions to > 0.01

# LONG TERM GOALS: 
-implement editing people
-fix lag when searching
-Add total owed to home screen
-Add tags

#Fixed: 
-filtered contacts in peopleView to include only those who have a transaction (past or ongoing)
-Standardised terms
