#BUGS:  I
-Implement no due date
-Scroll away keyboard
-edits in transaction detail regarding due date is not reflected within home page, but editing other fields seems to refresh it
-selectedForTransactions attribute not persisting
-restrict transactions to > 0.01
-sort unpaid people to the top in billsplit of transaction detail view

#LONG TERM GOALS: 
-implement editing people
-fix lag when searching
-Add total owed to home screen
-Add tags

#Fixed: 
-wording wrong in transaction detail regarding due/due in as transaction status is not specific to each person
-fixed issue where amount would not persist in textfield when switched to another view
-optimised ethan's code to display header in transactiondetailview
